employees of Healing Paws to organize, prioritize, and keep track of appointments. Healing Paws has
        three locations: Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu.</h2>
    <h2>
The solution must be cloud-based, and work on mobile as well as PCs. Healing Paws main concerns
        are the following:</h2>
    <h2>
• Ability for customers to make appointments for their pets. There are two appointment types:
emergency and standard. These will need to be handled by Healing Paws employees
accordingly. It should be possible for one customer to make appointments for multiple pets if
        possible.</h2>
    <h2>
• Ability for customers to see the status of their pets for serious cases when required. For
        instance, surgery date confirmed, surgery complete, pet ready for release, etc.</h2>
    <h2>• Ability for employees to organize, prioritize and keep track of pets in the system</h2>
    <h2>• Ability for customers to ask questions and for employees to answer them.</h2>
<h2>• The system should have two portals – one for customers and one for employees.</h2>
